# global configuration file
# this file stores general configuration for ran, along with your global variables, environment overrides and aliases.
# also you CAN'T use variables here.

# whether to ask for interactive prompt on conflicting app query (e.g. if query can refer to 2 or more apps)
# set to false if you want it to fail-fast on conflict without trying to show a dialogue/prompt.
interactive = true
# the text editor of your choice. this is used for editing app definition files and the config file itself.
# you can remove this or comment it out to let ran use $EDITOR, $VISUAL or nano/notepad if those are not set.
# editor = "nano"

# aliases for your applications.
# example:
# hks = "games/silksong"
# song = "silksong"
# ss = "hks" -- yes, you can use aliases to refer to aliases.
[alias]

# custom variables for your applications. (not environment variables. these are meant to be used in app definition files.)
# example:
# gamepath = "/data/apps/games"
# now you can use %gamepath% anywhere in your application definition file to refer to this variable.
[vars]

# global environment variable overrides. (Global meaning this applies to all apps. can be overriden
# by specific apps, but not command line environment)
# example:
# WINEPREFIX = "/data/apps/.prefixes/wine_common"
[env]
